README for txLoadBalancer

This is a pure python TCP load balancer. It takes inbound TCP connections and
connects them to one of a number of backend servers.

Project home: https://launchpad.net/txloadbalancer
Maintainer email: Duncan McGreggor <oubiwann@divmod.com>
Original author: Anthony Baxter <anthony@interlink.com.au>

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

$ twistd -noy ./bin/txlb.tac

This will use the default configuration file in ./etc/config.xml; you can edit
the .tac file to point to the config you prefer.

To enable the admin interface, your config file must have the admin section
defined, with the required fields. For an example, be sure to see
./etc/config.xml. For more details, please see the configuration information in
the ./doc directory.

If you are creating your own script and don't want to use txlb.tac, you can
import the application setup functions in txlb.application.

If you want to "embed" a load-balancer in your Twisted application, see the
example ./bin/txlbWeb.tac.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:

  - a pure-Twisted TCP loadbalancer

  - async i/o based, so much less overhead than fork/thread based balancers

  - Multiple scheduling algorithms (random, round robin, leastconns,
    leastconns-least-recently-used)

  - If a server fails to answer, it's removed from the pool - the client that
    failed to connect gets transparently failed over to a new host.

  - xml based configuration file

  - seperate management timer service that periodically re-adds failed hosts
    if they've come back up.

  - optional builtin webserver for admin

Performance:

Duncan's notes from 2008, tested on a 2 CPU Sun Netra 240:

  - a single apache instance on Solaris 10
        . starting threads:
        . max threads

  - 2 load-balanced apache instances on Solaris 10

  - twisted.web instances on Solaris 10 (same docroot)

  - 2 load-balanced twisted.web instances

  - PythonDirector 1.0.0 proxies for 2 load-balanced twisted.web instances

Anthony's original notes on performance:

  - On my notebook, load balancing an apache on the same local ethernet
    (serving a static 18K text file) gets 155 connections per second and
    2850 kbytes/s throughput (apachebench -n 2000 -c 10). Connecting directly
    to the apache gets 180 conns/sec and 3400kbytes/s. So unless you're
    serving really really stupidly high hit rates it's unlikely to be
    pythondirector causing you difficulties. (Note that 155 connections/sec
    is 13 million hits per day...)

  - Running purely over the loopback interface to a local apache seems to
    max out at around 350 conns/second.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from txLoadBalancer 1.0.1 to 1.1.0

- Massive API changes: competely reorganzied the code base.
- Integrated patches from Apple's Calendar Server project.
- A new API for creating load-balanced services within a Twisted application
  (without the need to run a separate load-balancingn daemon).
- Added support for live interaction with load-balancer via SSH connection to
  running Python interpretter (Twisted manhole).

Changes from txLoadBalancer 0.9.1 to 1.0.1

- 100% Twisted: removed all threading and asyncore code completely.
- Significan API changes.
- Dropped the web API.

Changes from PyDirector 1.0.0 to 1.1.1 (AKA txLoadBalancer 0.9.1)

- Added support for Twisted, providing the option for all management, admin and
  load-balancing to utilize the Twisted reactor, skipping threading and asycore
  altogether.

Changes from PyDirector 0.0.7 to 1.0.0

- Very few, mostly this is to update the project to 'stable' status.
- The networking code now uses twisted if available, and falls back
  to asyncore.

Changes from PyDirector 0.0.6 to 0.0.7

- You can specify a hostname of '*' to the listen directive for both
  the scheduler and the administrative interface to mean 'listen on
  all interfaces'. Considerably more obvious than '0.0.0.0'. Thanks
  to Andrew Sydelko for the idea.
- New "leastconnsrr" scheduler - this is leastconns, with a roundrobin
  as well. Previously, leastconns would keep the list of hosts sorted,
  which often meant one system got beaten up pretty badly.
- Twisted backend group selection works again.
- The client address is now passed to the scheduler's getHost() method.
  This allows the creation of "sticky" schedulers, where a client is
  (by preference) sent to the same backend server. The factory function
  for schedulers will change to allow things like "roundrobin,sticky".

Changes from PyDirector 0.0.5 to 0.0.6:

- fixed an error in the (hopefully rare) case where all backend servers
  are down.
- the main script uses resource.setrlimit() to boost the number of open
  filedescriptors (solaris has stupidly low defaults)
- when all backend servers are down, the manager thread goes into a much
  more aggressive mode re-adding them.
- handle comments in the config file

Changes from PyDirector 0.0.4 to 0.0.5:

- bunch of bugfixes to the logging
- re-implemented the networking code using the 'twisted' framework
  (a simple loopback test:
    asyncore based pydir:
      Requests per second:    107.72
      Transfer rate:          2462.69 kb/s received
    twisted based pydir:
      Requests per second:    197.90
      Transfer rate:          4519.69 kb/s received
    (5 way, 2000 fetches)
  )

Changes from PyDirector 0.0.3 to 0.0.4:

- can now specify more than one listener for a service
- 'client' in the config XML is now 'host'
- fixed a bug in leastconns and roundrobin scheduler if all backends
  were unavailable.
- whole lotta documentation added.
- running display in web api now shows count of total connections
- running display now has refresh and auto-refresh
- compareconf module - takes a running config and a new config and
  emits the web api commands needed to make the running config match
  the new config
- first cut at enabling https for web interface (needs m2crypto)

Changes from PyDirector 0.0.2 to 0.0.3:

- delHost hooked up
- running.xml added - XML dump of current config
- centralised logging - the various things that write logfile
  entries need to be made consistent, and a lot of additional
  logging needs to be added.
- Python2.1 compatibility fix: no socket.gaierror exception on 2.1

Changes from PyDirector 0.0.1 to 0.0.2:

- refactored web publishing (babybobo)
- package-ised and distutil-ised the code
